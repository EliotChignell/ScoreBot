# ScoreBot
A Discord bot to fetch scores for any major sport.

# How to run
1) Download ScoreBot either using `git clone https://github.com/EliotChignell/ScoreBot.git` or download the file as a zip.
2) Create a Disccord developer application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and make sure a bot is associated with the application.
3) Copy the bot token (never share this to anyone) and NOT the Client ID/Client Secret/Public Key.
4) Paste the bot token into `config.json.example`, replacing `t0k3n_g0e5_h3r3`.
5) Rename `config.json.example` to just `config.json`.
2) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer if you haven't already. I don't know the specific version required, default to the latest if things don't work.
3) Run `node bot.js`.
